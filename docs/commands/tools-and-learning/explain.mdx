# vai explain

Learn about embeddings, reranking, RAG, vector search, and more. Covers 30+ topics with explanations, key points, try-it commands, and links to further reading.

## Synopsis

```bash
vai explain [topic]
```

## Description

`vai explain` is an interactive learning tool built into vai. Run it without arguments to see all available topics, or pass a topic name to get a detailed explanation.

Each explanation includes:
- Clear, formatted content explaining the concept
- Practical "Try it" commands you can run immediately
- Links to official documentation

Topic names support fuzzy matching, so you don't need to type the exact key.

## Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `[topic]` | Topic to explain (optional, lists all if omitted) | — |
| `--json` | Machine-readable JSON output | — |

## Examples

### List all topics

```bash
vai explain
```

### Learn about embeddings

```bash
vai explain embeddings
```

### Learn about reranking

```bash
vai explain reranking
```

### Learn about shared embedding spaces

```bash
vai explain shared-space
```

### JSON output

```bash
vai explain embeddings --json
```

## Learning in the Playground

The `vai playground` integrates learning content throughout the interface with contextual help and tooltips.

### Contextual Help

Each tab in the playground includes inline guidance:

**Embed tab**: Explains input types, dimensions, and model selection with tooltips on each option.

**Search tab**: Describes how `$vectorSearch` works, what `numCandidates` means, and how filters are applied.

**Rerank tab**: Explains the difference between embedding-based similarity and cross-attention reranking.

**Similarity tab**: Describes cosine similarity and what the scores mean.

### Explore Topics

For deep dives into specific concepts, use the CLI:

```bash
vai explain embeddings
vai explain reranking
vai explain shared-space
vai explain rag
```

The playground complements the `explain` command by letting you immediately try concepts hands-on. Read about embeddings, then switch to the Embed tab and generate one.
