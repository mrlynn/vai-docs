**Command Reference** documents all 33 vai commands with synopsis, options, and examples.

**Guides** walk through real workflows:
- Building a RAG pipeline in 5 minutes
- Chatting with your documents using LLMs
- Composing multi-step workflows as JSON
- Setting up the MCP server in Claude Desktop or Cursor
- Benchmarking and evaluating retrieval quality

**API Reference** covers environment variables, MCP tool parameters, and the workflow JSON schema.

npm install -g voyageai-cli
